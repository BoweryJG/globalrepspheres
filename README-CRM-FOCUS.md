# README: CRM Automation Focus for Medical Sales Reps
*Updated: July 28, 2025*

## Strategic Pivot: Lead with CRM Pain, Not Follow-up Pain

### Key Insight
After analysis, focusing on **CRM automation** is more psychologically compelling than follow-up management because:
- Daily pain vs. occasional pain (reps hate CRM entry after EVERY call)
- Quantifiable ROI (5 hours/week saved = 260 hours/year)
- Immediate gratification (benefit felt after first call)
