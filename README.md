## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: version 18 or higher is recommended.
- **npm**: comes bundled with Node. Run `npm install` once after cloning the repo to install dependencies.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BoweryJG/globalrepspheres.git
   cd globalrepspheres
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your environment variables (see Environment Variables section)

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Useful npm scripts

- `npm start` – launches the development server with hot reloading
- `npm run build` – creates a production build in the `build` directory
- `npm run build:netlify` – creates a production build optimized for Netlify deployment
- `npm test` – runs the test suite
- `npm run eject` – ejects from Create React App (use with caution)

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
# AI and Search APIs
REACT_APP_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<your-openrouter-api-key>
REACT_APP_BRAVE_API_KEY=<your-brave-search-api-key>

# Supabase Configuration
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-supabase-anon-key>

# Backend and Analytics
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=<your-render-backend-url>  # e.g., https://osbackend-zl1h.onrender.com
REACT_APP_GA_ID=<your-google-analytics-id>

# Stripe Configuration (handled by backend)
# Your backend should have:
# STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<your-stripe-secret-key>
# STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<your-stripe-webhook-secret>
```

**Important**: After creating or modifying the `.env` file, you must restart the development server for the changes to take effect.

### API Keys Setup

1. **OpenRouter API**: Sign up at [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) to get an API key for Claude Opus 4
2. **Brave Search API**: Get your API key from [Brave Search API](https://api.search.brave.com/app/keys)
3. **Supabase**: Create a project at [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for authentication and database
4. **Google Analytics**: Set up GA4 property and get your measurement ID

The `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` should point to your deployed backend on Render (e.g. `https://your-backend-service.onrender.com`). This handles Stripe Checkout sessions and other server-side operations.

**Note**: The `.env` file is gitignored and should never be committed to version control.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Environment Variables Not Loading**
   - Ensure `.env` file is in the root directory
   - Restart the development server after making changes to `.env`
   - Check that all variable names start with `REACT_APP_`

2. **Chatbot Not Working**
   - Verify `REACT_APP_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set correctly
   - Ensure you have credits in your OpenRouter account
   - Check browser console for specific error messages

3. **Background Not Displaying Correctly**
   - Clear browser cache and reload
   - Check that no browser extensions are interfering with CSS
   - Verify WebGL is enabled in your browser

4. **Stripe Checkout Not Working**
   - Ensure `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` is set correctly (e.g., `https://osbackend-zl1h.onrender.com`)
   - Verify backend is running and has proper Stripe keys configured
   - Check that the backend endpoints use `/api/create-checkout-session`
   - Ensure all Stripe price IDs in PricingSection.js match your Stripe dashboard

5. **Navigation Links Not Working**
   - External modules (Market Data, Canvas, Sphere oS) require separate deployments
   - Internal links use React Router or query parameters
   - Check browser console for any CORS or network errors
