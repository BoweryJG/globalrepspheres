# Life Reclamation Hero Section - Design Documentation

## Final Hero Content

### **Headline:**
"Your 6-Year-Old Asked for One More Story. You Said No. For CRM Updates."

### **Subtitle:**
"RepSpheres automates everything the second your last call ends. Every word transcribed instantly. Every insight captured automatically. Every follow-up generated seamlessly. No logging. No updates. No guilt. Walk out at 5:01pm and mean it. Tonight, you read that extra story."

### **Primary CTA:**
"Read That Story Tonight →"

### **Secondary CTA:**
"See How Automation Works"

## Emotional Arc
**GUILT → SOLUTION → REDEMPTION**

This creates a powerful emotional journey that:
1. Opens with maximum parental guilt (specific child request denied)
2. Shows the absurdity of choosing admin work over precious moments
3. Promises immediate redemption through automation
4. Ends with hope and transformation

## Visual Design Concept

### Split Reality Theme
The hero section shows two parallel realities separated by a dramatic tear:

**Dark Reality (Left/Top on Mobile)**
- Parent at laptop at 8:17PM
- Cold blue screen glow
- Closed bedroom door with light underneath
- CRM fields falling like digital rain

**Light Reality (Right/Bottom on Mobile)**
- Parent reading bedtime story at 5:01PM
- Warm golden lighting
- Child's face illuminated with wonder
- Story elements floating upward

### Color Psychology
- **Dark Side**: Deep blues (#0A0B1E), cold glow (#4A90E2), harsh reds (#FF4444)
- **Light Side**: Warm golds (#FFD700), soft ambers (#FFA500), cozy creams (#FFF8DC)
- **Automation**: Electric purple (#9F58FA) bridging realities
- **Transition**: Gradients shifting from cold to warm
